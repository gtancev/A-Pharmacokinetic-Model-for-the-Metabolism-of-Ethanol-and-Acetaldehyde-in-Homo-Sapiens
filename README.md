# Pharmacokinetic-Modeling-of-Ethanol-Degradation

Despite the social graces of alcoholic beverages, one has to be performance-capable after a night
of drinking. There are different questions that come up; how much can someone afford to drink
until midnight in order not to have a hangover the next morning? Or when does one have to
stop at the latest? A mathematical model could answer such questions, but a definition and
feasible quantification of "performance-capable" is needed first.

The aim of this work was to present a pharmacokinetic model that describes the ethanol
metabolism in human beings and to perform a parameter estimation based on in silico gen-
erated data. Furthermore, a model analysis should provide information about the quality of the
estimated parameters. Model improvement was not part of the aim of this project as all data
were generated from the model itself.
